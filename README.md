# shirc
The worst IRC "client" you will ever use.
Essentially just pushes messages to different files but still technically a
client.

## Usage
Read the comments at the top of `./shirc`.

Stay away from `./frontend.sh`, it was written as a PoC for `shirc`.
You could probably use it as a frontend for `shirc` but I would feel incredibly
sorry for you.
It is slow even on a modern machine, written horribly, and best of all: word
wraps but ignores ANSI escape codes.
